<h2 id="june-12-2017">June 12, 2017</h2>
<p>CHICAGO – Responding to the health and safety threat posed by the abuse of new designer drugs that are synthesized and marketed to circumvent drug laws, the American Medical Association (AMA) today voted to support a comprehensive, multidisciplinary effort to close a gap in the nation’s ability to identify, regulate, and mitigate the dangers posed by new psychoactive substances.</p>
<p>New psychoactive substances – or NPS – mimic the effects of a wide range of substances, including prescription opioids, cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, and central nervous system depressants. NPS are sold as “legal highs” and alternatives to established drugs of abuse. NPS have been increasingly associated with hospital emergencies, acute adverse health consequences, and drug-induced death.</p>
<p>“Although Congress passed AMA-supported legislation in 2012 that placed 26 synthetic drugs in Schedule 1 under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), drug traffickers have devised ways to circumvent federal drug laws by slightly altering the chemical structure of their products and designing new synthetic drugs,” said Patrice A. Harris, M.D., chair of the AMA Board of Trustees and the AMA Task Force on Opioid Abuse. “These new products are currently unregulated and are frequently marketed to young people as innocent products like “bath salts,” plant food, or incense. They also include variations of the extremely dangerous opioid fentanyl, which has been wreaking havoc across the country and resulting in a sharp increase in drug overdoses and deaths due to such overdoses.”</p>
<p>Delegates at the AMA Annual Meeting voted to support multifaceted, collaborative multiagency approach to combat NPS. Delegates also supported increased NPS surveillance and early warning systems for more actionable information that can quickly aid law enforcement, public health officials, emergency physicians, and vulnerable populations in mitigating the growing NPS problem.</p>
<p>Public health approaches have been used to successfully address outbreaks of NPS overdoses. When such approaches have been successful, pre-existing coordinated relationships among multiple stakeholders have allowed for a rapid and comprehensive response to a given outbreak.</p>
<p>In addition to the newly adopted policies for eliminating the NPS threat, the AMA is also supporting the “Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2017” (H.R. 1732) that would require the Attorney General of the United States to assign Schedule I classification to approximately 250 dangerous new synthetic substances identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration since 2012.</p>
<p>In an effort to consider promising strategies that could reduce the health and societal problems associated with injection drug use, the AMA today voted to support the development of pilot facilities where people who use intravenous drugs can inject self-provided drugs under medical supervision.</p>
<p>Studies from other countries have shown that supervised injection facilities reduce the number of overdose deaths, reduce transmission rates of infectious disease, and increase the number of individuals initiating treatment for substance use disorders without increasing drug trafficking or crime in the areas where the facilities are located.</p>
<p>“State and local governments around the nation are currently involved in exploratory efforts to create supervised injection facilities to help reduce public health and societal impacts of illegal drug use,” said Dr. Harris.“Pilot facilities will help inform U.S . policymakers on the feasibility, effectiveness and legal aspects of supervised injection facilities in reducing harms and health care costs associated with injection drug use.”</p>
<p>The examination of this issue by physicians at the AMA Annual Meeting was greatly assisted by the Massachusetts Medical Society and its recently completed comprehensive study of the literature associated with supervised injection facilities.</p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="g2998"><h2 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#g2999">The Lancet</button></h2></div>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>We examined population-based overdose mortality rates for the period before (Jan 1, 2001, to Sept 20, 2003) and after (Sept 21, 2003, to Dec 31, 2005) the opening of the Vancouver SIF. The location of death was determined from provincial coroner records. We compared overdose fatality rates within an a priori specified 500 m radius of the SIF and for the rest of the city.</p>
<h3 id="findings">Findings</h3>
<p>Of 290 decedents, 229 (79·0%) were male, and the median age at death was 40 years (IQR 32–48 years). A third (89, 30·7%) of deaths occurred in city blocks within 500 m of the SIF. The fatal overdose rate in this area decreased by 35·0% after the opening of the SIF, from 253·8 to 165·1 deaths per 100 000 person-years (p=0·048). By contrast, during the same period, the fatal overdose rate in the rest of the city decreased by only 9·3%, from 7·6 to 6·9 deaths per 100 000 person-years (p=0·490). There was a significant interaction of rate differences across strata (p=0·049).</p>

<p>SIFs should be considered where injection drug use is prevalent, particularly in areas with high densities of overdose.</p>

<h2 id="safe-injection-facilities-save-lives">Safe Injection Facilities Save Lives</h2>
<p>To fight the opioid crisis, let substance users shoot up  under medical supervision</p>
<p> ## By THE EDITORS on January 29, 2018</p>
<p> Annual opioid fatalities have now surpassed the yearly  number of deaths from AIDS at the height of that epidemic in  the mid&ndash;1990s. In 2016 drug overdose deaths numbered 63,000,  more than the U.S. death toll from the entire Vietnam War.  The trend is terrifying: the problem is getting worse each  year.</p>
<p> Cities and states reeling from opioid deaths need to give  serious consideration to setting up safe injection rooms,  which could significantly reduce fatalities. These are  places where a drug user can go to consume illegal drugs  under the supervision of health workers. They have been used  in Europe, Canada and Australia for decades, and evidence  and experience there shows they are very effective. This may  not seem like an obvious way to fight an abuse epidemic, but  there are few other options. While in the U.S., many cities’  efforts to establish such sites have stalled, Philadelphia  is now poised to open the country’s first officially  sanctioned safe injection site.</p>
<p> The misuse of prescription opioids such as OxyContin is  inextricably linked with that of street drugs such as  heroin. Nearly half of young people who inject heroin  started by abusing prescription drugs. Then they turned to  the cheaper, more readily available alternative. The path  from pills to needles has meant that U.S. deaths from heroin  have increased by a factor of five since 2010, topping  15,000 people in 2016. The number of dead is continuing to  climb as people overdose on heroin laced with fentanyl, a  synthetic opioid that makes heroin much more potent—and thus  more deadly.</p>
<p> That’s where safe injection sites would come in. At more  than 90 such locations in Europe and elsewhere, if someone  overdoses at one of these sites, a health worker or other  first responder quickly administers an antidote. The  injection facilities also have proved they can reduce the  transmission of blood-borne infections, partly through  needle-exchange programs. They can also save money: in San  Francisco, for example, one analysis concluded that for  every dollar spent on such sites, $2.33 in emergency  medical, law enforcement and other costs would be reduced,  producing a yearly net savings of $3.5 million.</p>
<p> The evidence for increased safety is compelling. At Insite,  a safe-injection site in Vancouver, for example, there was a  35 percent reduction in fatal overdoses in the area around  the facility, compared with a 9.3 percent reduction in other  parts of the city that may have had other interventions.  People who used Insite were also much less likely to share  needles than individuals who shot up in unsupervised places.  And Insite helped get people clean. Of the 6,532 people who  visited the facility in 2015, 464 were referred to addiction  treatment, and more than half of them completed it.</p>
<p> Critics argue, correctly, that safe injection sites are not  a perfect solution on their own. Our country needs more  drug-treatment beds and counseling options, medication  assistance to help with drug withdrawal and other  evidence-based care to alleviate the crisis. Safe sites also  work best in places where drug use is centralized, such as  in specific urban neighborhoods rather than rural areas. And  of course, they are controversial because they require  officials to tacitly accept illegal drug use.</p>
<p> That is why no American city has yet cleared the necessary  hurdles to proceed with establishing an injection site. San  Francisco and Denver are among the jurisdictions that have  considered this option. Seattle, too, has called for two  safe-consumption rooms and has even set aside funds to  support them, but its effort has been mired in legal  battles. Federal law currently makes it illegal to use  nonprescribed opiates and opioids, so Philadelphia officials  have said they would not fund or operate such a facility.  They would instead encourage private efforts to open  one—which would perhaps providing slightly more legal  distance than if they were to finance and manage it  themselves. Still, the U.S. Department of Justice may choose  to prosecute the city for supporting the move. (The Mayor’s  office told Scientific American in a statement that “We’re  aware of federal concerns but given the depth of the problem  and the number of lives impacted, we need to be bold in our  approach.”)</p>
<p> But the stakes are high. If this site does get off the  ground, it could finally pave the way for other cities to  follow suit—giving communities new hope that the rising  death toll from the opioid crisis might finally begin to  reverse.</p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="g3002"><h2 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#g3003">Annals of Internal Medicine</button></h2></div>

<h3 id="jessie-m-gaeta-md-and-melanie-racine-mph">Jessie M. Gaeta, MD, and Melanie Racine, MPH</h3>
<p>Last summer, the lifeless body of a 26-year-old heroin-using man, Tim (not his real name), was dis- covered in the shadows of a side street in Boston. Ninety minutes before, he had come to our clinic at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, mere blocks away, pleading for help. He told us with certainty that he was going to relapse that day, ending 6 weeks of hard-earned sobriety. Our nurse offered to connect Tim to treatment at the nearby methadone clinic or our office-based addiction treatment program, but he refused. He said he wasn’t ready to enter another treatment program: What he wanted, simply, was accompaniment while he used. “I’m just looking for a ‘buddy’ to go with me. I don’t want to die.”</p>
<p>The nurse made sure Tim had a naloxone rescue kit in his pocket and counseled him that his tolerance was lower than usual and he should start with a reduced “test” dose. With no friends available to accompany him, and without the legal authority to allow him to stay in our building, our staff watched Tim walk out the door for the last time. When he was found an hour and a half later—in the shadow of a world-class medical center and a large needle-exchange program, with naloxone at arm’s length—alone, we found ourselves agonizing over the limits of our current options for helping people like him.</p>
<p>With the explosion of highly potent fentanyl and its analogues in the illicit drug supply, overdose fatalities are occurring with alarming frequency and speed—often within minutes or even seconds of injection, leaving little time for first responders to find and resuscitate victims. For this reason, we often advise people to use with a friend and recommend that persons who use drugs, or who are around those who use drugs, carry the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Most of them do, and thousands of “peer saves” in Boston and across the country have been credited to expanded naloxone education and distribution. We regularly connect patients to detoxification programs, residential treatment pro- grams, medication for addiction treatment, and a host of other resources for treatment of substance use dis- order. But in too many cases we are constrained in our ability to save people like Tim: the ones who are unable to stop using today but don’t want to die.</p>
<p>It was this desperation that drove us to open the Supportive Place for Observation and Treatment (SPOT) in 2016 (1), where Tim had presented that day and where we’d gotten to know him over the previous months. SPOT is a nonjudgmental space focused on reducing the harms of drug use, where people who have ingested drugs nearby and who are over sedated can walk in to be medically monitored and connected to services and treatment. This program has allowed us to forge deep relationships with people who actively use drugs and be as close to them as possible while they are intoxicated. In the first year at SPOT, we saw 500 unique, high-risk people in more than 3800 encounters. In addition to preventing emergency department visits by providing medical monitoring on site and responding to overdose with supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and naloxone as needed, we’ve used SPOT as a key conduit to treatment: In a sample of 409 patients who received care at SPOT, 23.5% were referred directly to substance use treatment, which could include inpatient detoxification, methadone treatment, office-based addiction treatment with buprenorphine or naltrexone, behavioral therapies, or some combination of these. Fifty-five percent of persons referred to treatment directly from SPOT successfully accessed it.</p>
<p>Yet, as Tim’s case painfully reminds us, SPOT is not enough. In our urgency to bring an end to these senseless deaths, we now support a strategy that other countries adopted as early as 1984: supervised injection facilities (SIFs). Approximately 100 of these facilities in 11 countries across Europe, North America, and Australia have been studied for decades. They offer sterile equipment and a hygienic environment for medically supervised injection of drugs obtained off site. They also offer education about reducing harms; access to lifesaving naloxone; and connection to primary health care services, counseling, and treatment for substance use disorder.</p>
<p>More than 100 peer-reviewed studies on SIFs have offered compelling evidence that they reduce mortality (2) and overdose (3) while increasing the safety of injection behaviors (3) (which is linked to reduced infectious disease transmission) and access to addiction treatment (4, 5). At the same time, research has shown that they do not increase public disorder or attract drug-related crime to an area (3) or increase relapse rates (6).</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Medical Society and the American Medical Association now both support development of pilot SIFs in the United States (7, 8) as part of a multi pronged approach to this devastating epidemic. Pilot programs would allow us to study the effect of these facilities while providing despairing communities with an additional strategy to mitigate overdose deaths and connect people to treatment.</p>
<p>Would widespread SIFs be accepted by people who inject drugs? From our experience, the answer is a resounding “yes.” Not only do we hear this on a daily basis in our clinics, but in a survey of 237 people who use drugs at Boston’s needle-exchange program, we have found that 91% of participants reported they would be willing to use a SIF (9). Furthermore, Kral and colleagues (10) recently documented the high utilization an unsanctioned SIF in an undisclosed U.S. city.</p>
<p>If the opioid overdose epidemic continues at any- where near its current rate, more than half a million more persons will die in the United States in the next 10 years. As health care practitioners, we have a duty to advocate for the development and study of interventions that have shown promise in promoting health and saving lives. We endorse SIFs as 1 piece of a comprehensive continuum of care for this chronic, relapsing disease. Only by heeding the calls for help of those suffering with substance use disorder will we find a way out of this epidemic. As Tim’s death demonstrates, sometimes, in the moment, treatment is not the only help that is needed: Sometimes it is bringing addiction out of the shadows.</p>
